> We want you working on things you're excited about!
 
## Testing

We physically test the code with available components to check for errors and way to enhance the program. Any issues will be reported for fixing.
 
## Submitting changes

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to ArduinoStuff](https://github.com/Codinosaur/ArduinoStuff/pulls) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).
Please follow our coding conventions (below) and make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."

 
 ## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

  * We use Arduino IDE for writing code.
  * Arduino UNO is the supported board.
  * Provide notice for addition of new electronic components i.e new motors,sensors or shields.
  * We almost ALWAYS use  ```c++ ``` for development.
  * However integration of new programming language support the main  ```.ino``` file can be done.
  * Using comments is highly recommended to improve readibility.
